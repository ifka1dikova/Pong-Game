# Pong-Game

This game was made as a first year assignment in the "Creative coding" module during my studies in UWE.

#Information & Instructions
The Pong Game was designed by Allan Alcorn, manufactured by Atari and released in 1972. The game is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. Each player controls a paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. Both players use the paddles to hit the ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach 10 points before the opponent. The player wins a point when his opponent fails to return the ball to him. Player one controls are UP and Down ARROW. Player two controls are W and S keys! Each time when a player reaches 10 points both players go to the next level with a slightly different design. Enjoy the Game!
